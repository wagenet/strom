//! Stinger transitions: a clip played over the program while the source
//! changes beneath it.
//!
//! Three variants, after the conventions of ATEM, vMix and OBS:
//! - **Classic**: a graphic with an alpha channel that covers the frame at a
//!   cut point, where the program cuts or mixes beneath it.
//! - **Track matte**: the clip carries a matte beside or below the graphic
//!   (the OBS layout). Black in the matte shows the old source, white the new
//!   one, grey blends; the switch follows the clip frame by frame.
//! - **Mask only**: the whole clip is a matte, with no graphic: an animated
//!   wipe.
//!
//! The matte variants need the GPU mixer; the software mixer plays them as a
//! classic stinger.
