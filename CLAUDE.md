## Project Overview
- **Frontend** (`strom-frontend`): egui-based GUI that compiles to both native and WASM
- **Backend** (`strom-backend`): Axum server that can run the native GUI and serve the embedded WASM version

## Language
- All code, comments, commit messages, PR titles, PR descriptions, and documentation must be in English

## Security
- Always anonymize sensitive data (IP addresses, hostnames, credentials, internal server names) before including in commits, PRs, or documentation
- Use `example.com`, `192.0.2.x`, or placeholder values instead of real infrastructure data

## Code Style
- Do not add emojis to log macros (`info!`, `debug!`, `trace!`, `warn!`, `error!`)
- If you find emojis in existing log rows, remove them. Emojis in UI icons are OK.

## GStreamer Pad Probes
- BUFFER probes fire on **every single buffer** in the pipeline — they are the hottest path in GStreamer. Never add a BUFFER probe without careful consideration.
- Inside a BUFFER probe callback: no Mutex locks, no heap allocations, no string formatting, no system calls. Use atomics and pre-computed values instead.
- Prefer `Instant::now()` over `SystemTime::now()` (Instant uses the vDSO fast path on Linux).
- For rate-limiting inside a BUFFER probe, use `AtomicU64` with `Instant`-based epoch offsets rather than `Mutex<Instant>`.
- EVENT_DOWNSTREAM probes (for caps detection, one-time setup) are fine — they fire infrequently.
- When reviewing or adding a probe, always ask: "Does this fire per-buffer or per-event?" and treat per-buffer probes as performance-critical code.

## GStreamer Object References in Closures
- **NEVER capture a strong reference (`clone()`) to a `gst::Pipeline`, `gst::Element`, or `gst::Bin` inside a signal handler closure** (e.g. `connect_pad_added`, `connect_element_added`, `connect("deep-element-added", ...)`). Elements own their signal handlers — capturing the pipeline or sibling elements creates a circular reference that prevents GStreamer from ever finalizing the pipeline. All OS resources (UDP sockets, threads, file descriptors) will leak on every pipeline restart.
- Use `WeakRef` (`ObjectExt::downgrade()`) instead, and `upgrade()` inside the closure. If upgrade returns `None`, the pipeline is already torn down — just return early.
- This also applies to `HashMap<String, gst::Element>` maps — never clone and capture the map; build a `HashMap<String, WeakRef<gst::Element>>` instead.
- The regression test `pipeline_lifecycle_test.rs` catches these leaks — it must always pass.
- `stop_flow()` in `state.rs` logs `ERROR` at runtime if a pipeline survives after drop — treat these as P0 bugs.

## GStreamer Queues
- Leave `queue`, `queue2`, and `multiqueue` elements with default property values unless there is a documented latency requirement that justifies overriding them.

## GStreamer Memory Formats
- A block emits the memory type it naturally produces (system, GL, CUDA, ...). The **consuming** block adapts its own input. A producer does not know its consumer, so any producer-side download is wrong for half the graph and costs a GPU round trip per frame in the other half.
- Adapt at build time where the input is known (`glupload` on a GL consumer's inputs). Where it depends on what `decodebin` autoplugged upstream, decide from the negotiated caps — `gst::video_input_bridge` does this for WHEP Output's video input.
- Beware sinks that advertise GPU memory features they cannot actually process: `whepserversink` accepts `video/x-raw(memory:GLMemory)` and then fails encoder discovery. A successful link is not proof the consumer can use the frames.

## Output Block Inputs
- This applies to output blocks that carry encoded media (SRT, RTMP, recorder, TAMS, ...). Outputs whose target takes raw media (NDI, DeckLink, AES67) take raw only. WebRTC outputs (WHEP, WHIP) are exempt from the video rule below: codec negotiation is part of the protocol, and the sink encodes.
- **Video must arrive encoded.** Refuse raw video and name `builtin.videoenc` in the message. Never encode video inside an output block: codec, profile and bitrate are the operator's choice, made in one explicit block.
- **Audio may arrive either way.** Pass encoded audio through as it is. Encode raw audio inside the block, with defaults that suit the target.
- Check what the target actually accepts from the negotiated caps, not only the caps name. That means the codec, and also `profile` where the target restricts it.
- **A refusal fails the flow, with a message the operator can act on.** Post an element error from the block (`gst::element_error!`) saying what arrived, what the target needs, and which block property fixes it. Do not only log the refusal and leave the pad unlinked: the flow then shows only `Internal data stream error`, or a track goes missing without a word.

## Code Organization
- When working in or near a file that exceeds 1500 lines, proactively suggest splitting it into focused sub-modules (following the pattern used for `pipeline.rs` and `app.rs`)
- Each sub-module should have a single clear responsibility (e.g. construction, lifecycle, linking, properties)
- Check for large files with: `find backend/src frontend/src -name "*.rs" | xargs wc -l | sort -rn | head -20`

## Documentation
- **The code is the source of truth.** Do not write or maintain docs that describe how the code works, its design, or its implementation — that documentation always drifts.
- Repo docs (`docs/`) are for navigation only: what Strom is, what it can do, how to set it up, how to contribute, and how things fit together at a high level. Keep them there.
- Do not create code-describing / design / implementation docs at top level. Anything that explains internals belongs in `docs/archive/` with a disclaimer (or should not exist).
- Operator/usage guides (how to *use* a feature) may stay top-level, but carry the disclaimer: "Code is the source of truth — this may have drifted; read the code for the current implementation." Do not cite file paths in disclaimers (paths drift too) — just say "read the code".
- Doc filenames in `docs/` use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g. `DOCKER_GPU_SETUP.md`). Leave `README.md` and `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*` lowercase (GitHub convention).
- There is no committed roadmap. Ideas go in `docs/FEATURE_SUGGESTIONS.md` (an unordered "not a roadmap" list) or as GitHub Issues/Discussions.
- Strom is authored by Claude Code (AI), not hand-written by humans. We welcome feature requests, ideas, and (ideally AI-written) PRs.

## Shared Types (`strom-types`)
- Before defining a new struct, enum, constant, or default value — always check if it already exists in `strom-types`. All new API-visible or shared types must be placed in `strom-types`, never directly in the backend. If you find a duplicate, move it to `strom-types`.
- `strom-types` must not depend on the backend, GStreamer crates, or other internal crates — only pure utility crates such as `serde` and `uuid`.

## API Contract
- Every new endpoint must have a `#[utoipa::path(...)]` annotation AND be registered in `openapi.rs`. Both are required — an annotation without registration does not appear in the schema.
- After changes to API types or endpoints, run the snapshot test (`cargo test --test openapi_test`). If it fails, update `openapi.json` in the repo root intentionally — do not silently let the schema drift.

## WebSocket Contract
- Any type referenced by a new `StromEvent` variant must have a `ToSchema` annotation (`#[cfg_attr(feature = "openapi", derive(ToSchema))]`). If the variant introduces new inner types, those need `ToSchema` too.
- Never modify an existing `StromEvent` variant (rename, change fields, remove) without treating it as an intentional breaking change.

## Tests
- A regression test must exercise the code it guards — it has to call the changed module, not rebuild equivalent behaviour inline. A test that reconstructs a pipeline topology by hand documents a bug; it does not stop the bug returning.
- A regression test must fail if the fix is reverted. If it hardcodes the fixed path (e.g. a `use_queues: true` flag with no failing counterpart), it is a demonstration, not a guard — say so in the PR body and explain why a real guard is not feasible.
- A test that requires a GStreamer element must be able to run in CI. Tests that skip on a missing element pass green and guard nothing, so check the package list in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` before relying on one, and add the missing package in the same PR.
- State in the PR body which tests you actually ran, and which were skipped or not run. "CI is green" is not the same as "the new test executed".
- Write the PR body from `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. `gh pr create --body` and `--body-file` skip the template, so read it first. The scheduled fix stage follows `scripts/agent/FIX.md` instead.

## Dead Code
- Never use blanket `#![allow(dead_code)]`. Each case must be handled individually. Never use `#[allow(dead_code)]` in `strom-types`.
- For target-specific code (e.g. only used in WASM or only in native), use `#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]` or `#[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]` — not `#[allow(dead_code)]`.
- `#[allow(dead_code)]` is acceptable only for serde deserialization fields or event data fields that mirror the backend but are not yet displayed in the UI.

## Build
- Always build with `cargo check`, `cargo build`, or `cargo run` — never use the `-p` flag
- Build from the workspace root
- For focused frontend/GUI work, use `trunk serve` in the `frontend/` directory for a fast iteration loop — avoids full WASM compilation and server restart on every change. Work against `trunk serve` for visual fixes, then verify against the full backend when done.

## Static Files
- Static files (HTML/JS/CSS in `backend/static/`) are embedded at compile time via rust-embed
- Editing static files requires `cargo build` + server restart to take effect
- Bump the version number in the HTML after changes so the browser-loaded version can be verified

## Process Management
- Before starting the server or any test process, check if it is already running (`ps`, `curl`, log grep)

## Troubleshooting

### GUI Issues
1. Add logging to `strom-frontend`
2. Recompile and restart the backend. In native GUI mode (default), the backend log shows the full application log

### Pipeline Errors and Segfaults
- Use `GST_DEBUG` and `GST_DEBUG_FILE` for GStreamer logs
- Use config logging in `.strom.toml`, set level to `debug` or `trace`, then monitor the log file
- See `/docs` for segfault troubleshooting
- Do not suggest blacklisting elements when troubleshooting segfaults
