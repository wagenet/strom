//! Asking a WHIP publisher for a keyframe, and knowing when to stop.
//!
//! A browser sends H.264 parameter sets (SPS/PPS, as a STAP-A packet) only
//! alongside a keyframe. If a session's first keyframe does not arrive — the
//! publisher was already running, the burst was dropped, the receiver came up
//! a moment late — then `rtph264depay` receives nothing but fragmented
//! non-reference slices. It can reassemble them (the FU-A start/end bits pair
//! up fine) but without parameter sets it cannot set caps, so it never outputs
//! an access unit, `decodebin` never exposes a pad, and the flow's pipeline
//! never leaves PAUSED. Audio is unaffected, which is why the symptom reads as
//! "audio works, video doesn't".
//!
//! Measured on a real session: 14830 FU-A fragments, 1987 complete fragmented
//! NAL units, zero STAP-A packets, zero completed access units. Every session
//! that worked had at least one STAP-A.
//!
//! The remedy is to ask: an upstream force-key-unit event on the WHIP source
//! pad becomes a PLI to the publisher, which answers with a keyframe and the
//! parameter sets that travel with it.
//!
//! This module is the part worth testing: *when* to ask, and when to stop.
//! Asking is cheap but not free — a forced keyframe is a bitrate spike — so a
//! healthy session should be asked at most once, while its first frames are still
//! crossing the decode chain, and a stalled one should be asked a bounded number
//! of times and then left alone.
