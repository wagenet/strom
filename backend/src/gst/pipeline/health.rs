//! Detection of stalled pad tasks in a running pipeline.
//!
//! A pad task is the thread that drives data out of a pad. Elements pause their
//! own task when a downstream push fails with a non-fatal flow return such as
//! `not-negotiated` - video encoders do this, and so does `GstAggregator`,
//! which additionally marks all its sink pads flushing, stalling everything
//! upstream of it. Neither posts to the bus, and pausing a task is not a state
//! change, so the pipeline and every element in it stay `PLAYING` while that
//! branch carries nothing.
//!
//! `GstBaseSrc` is the exception: it posts a flow error before pausing, so
//! source-side failures already reach the bus handler.
//!
//! Scope: the scan reaches the flow pipeline's own elements and the bins beneath
//! them, and nothing else. Blocks that run an isolated `gst::Pipeline` of their
//! own - WHIP ingest sessions, a Media Player's decode chain - are siblings of
//! that pipeline rather than children of it, so `iterate_recurse` never enters
//! them. An `Ok` here therefore means "no stalled pad task among this flow
//! pipeline's elements", not "this flow is passing data". Sinks that live in the
//! flow pipeline, `whepserversink` included, are covered.
//!
//! A paused task on an element that is itself `PLAYING` is always wrong, so
//! that is the signal used here. `gst_pad_get_task_state()` returns `Stopped`
//! both for a pad whose task was stopped and for a pad that never had one, so
//! `Stopped` cannot be told apart from the common case and is not reported.
//!
//! The scan cannot see a chain that is linked and simply never pushed to: its
//! elements sit idle and `PLAYING` with no task to pause. Only the block that
//! owns it knows, so a block may report on itself through `BlockLiveness`, and
//! the scan folds that verdict in.

///
/// A pad that has seen EOS is finished by definition: `gst_base_src_loop` pauses
/// its task on the way out for *every* reason including end of stream, and the
/// element stays `PLAYING` afterwards, so a finite source that has played out
/// would otherwise be reported as failed forever. The stall this looks for
/// pushes no EOS.
///
/// An unlinked pad has no branch to report on. A `queue` feeding a block output
/// that the flow leaves unconnected gets `not-linked` from its loop and parks
/// the task there permanently - the vision mixer's `multiview_out` does exactly
/// this whenever a flow uses only the program output.
///
/// That exclusion holds only because every `tee` Strom builds sets
/// `allow-not-linked`, which keeps the `not-linked` at the unconnected branch.
/// A `tee` with its default instead returns `not-linked` upstream once all its
/// branches are unconnected, so the task that parks is the one feeding the tee,
/// on a pad that does have a peer. A raw `tee` element in a user flow does
/// exactly that, and the element upstream of it is reported as failed.
///
/// A task on an element that has never been fed is idle, not stalled, as long
/// as its own pushes have not failed. `vtenc` parks its output task on reaching
/// `PLAYING` and starts it on the first frame, so a Video Encoder on an empty
/// seat would otherwise read as failed for as long as the seat stays empty. A
/// segment must precede the first buffer, so an element with no segment on any
/// sink pad has never received data. A failed push still counts, fed or not.
/// The last flow return cannot stand alone: an aggregator that fails to
/// renegotiate pauses without pushing, so its last flow stays `Ok`.
