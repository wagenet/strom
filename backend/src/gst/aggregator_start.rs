/// Stop an aggregator from rewinding its output to 0 when the first buffer
/// reaches one of its inputs.
///
/// `GstAggregator` selects its start time when the first buffer arrives on any
/// sink pad. With `start-time-selection=zero` that sets the output position to
/// `MIN(0, position)`. A `force-live` aggregator does not wait for that buffer:
/// while its inputs are empty it times out and outputs silence (or background)
/// on the pipeline clock. So in a flow that starts before anyone publishes to
/// a WHIP slot, the first real buffer arrives seconds later and moves the
/// position back to 0. The next output buffer is stamped 0, with a duration
/// that reaches forward to the correct end, and the stream then carries on.
/// One buffer, but `opusenc` rejects it ("buffer going too far back in time"),
/// and webrtcsink ends every WHEP viewer session connected at that moment.
///
/// `gst_aggregator_update_segment` turns that selection off. The segment passed
/// is the aggregator's initial one: start 0, position unset. Both
/// `GstAudioAggregator` and `GstVideoAggregator` read an unset position as the
/// segment start, so output still begins at 0, as zero start-time selection
/// would place it.
///
/// Call before the element leaves NULL. A PAUSED to READY change turns the
/// selection back on; flows build a new pipeline on every start, so that path
/// is not taken here.
