//! Recorder block for writing audio/video streams to file.
//!
//! Uses splitmuxsink with mp4mux (default), matroskamux, or mpegtsmux for container format.
//! Supports automatic file splitting by time or size.
//!
//! Only pre-encoded material is accepted — the recorder does not encode.
//! Use encoder blocks upstream if you have raw video/audio (e.g. after WHIP ingest).
//!
//! Input handling (dynamic parser insertion via pad probe):
//! - Video: H.264 -> h264parse (config-interval=-1), H.265 -> h265parse (config-interval=-1)
//! - Audio: AAC -> aacparse, MP3 -> mpegaudioparse, AC3 -> ac3parse, Opus -> opusparse, DTS -> dcaparse
//! - Raw video/audio: rejected with a clear error message
//!
//! Pipeline structure:
//! ```text
//! video_in (identity) --[pad probe]--> [parser] --> splitmuxsink:video_0
//! audio_in_N (identity) --[pad probe]--> [parser chain] --> splitmuxsink:audio_0..N
//! ```
//!
//! splitmuxsink stalls forever on a pad that is never fed, so sink pads are requested at
//! pipeline start for connected tracks only — not for every configured track, and not
//! lazily from the pad probes.
//!
//! The sink itself stays locked until a track's caps arrive, so a recorder whose input
//! never carries data cannot hold the pipeline out of PLAYING (see
//! `prepare_idle_recording_sink`). The `ts_passthrough` multifilesink is locked the same
//! way, from the single caps probe on its static input.
//!
//! A track that carried data and then stopped is a different matter: splitmuxsink goes on
//! waiting for it and the whole recording freezes. `spawn_track_stall_watchdog` ends such
//! a track so the others keep recording, and starts a new file with it once it carries
//! data again.
//!
//! A flow stop sends EOS into every track before the pipeline goes to NULL, so the
//! current file is finished rather than cut off (see `drain_recording`).
//!
//! Output files are written to: {media_path}/{output_dir}/{filename_prefix}_%05d.{ext}

///    through, it would reach the pipeline as the recorder's end of stream:
///    splitmuxsink forwards it once the primary video pad has ended, which is
///    exactly the case this recovers from.

///    input, which still holds its current caps and segment. Tracks that stay out
///    get no pad, so the new file does not wait for them.

///    recorder. A live pipeline ignores a child's ASYNC_START anyway, but one
///    that is not live would otherwise go back to PAUSED until the new file
///    prerolls.
/// 5. Each track replays what its input kept while parked, from the first
///    keyframe on, and goes live (see `replay_stash`). The stall check keeps
///    running meanwhile: a replay can wait on a track that died in the switch.

/// from its last periodic update, seconds short. EOS on every track is what makes
/// splitmuxsink end the file properly.
///
/// The EOS goes into the queue in front of each splitmuxsink pad, behind the
/// buffers already waiting there, so nothing that reached the recorder is lost.
/// A pad with no queue linked (a connected track that never carried data) takes
/// it directly, which is what releases splitmuxsink's wait on that track. Each
/// send gets its own thread: a serialized event waits for the pad's stream lock,
/// and the thread holding it can be parked inside splitmuxsink until another
/// track's EOS has gone in.
///
/// Done is EOS leaving the muxer once `muxer_inputs_ended`, so a split still in
/// progress at stop does not read as the end.
///
/// Nothing is sent until splitmuxsink has a file open (`file_opened`). Before
/// that, EOS would make it open one just to end it: an mp4 with its moov
/// reservation and nothing in it, which does not play. A track's caps unlock the
/// sink before its first buffer, so an unlocked sink is not enough: a video
/// encoder with lookahead spends a quarter of a second there while audio is
/// already arriving.
