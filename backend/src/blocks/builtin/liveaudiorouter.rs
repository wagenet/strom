//! Live Audio Router block — the same routing model as `builtin.audiorouter`,
//! but the crosspoints can be changed on a running flow, and each crosspoint
//! carries a gain rather than an on/off flag.
//!
//! Built on the pattern the audio mixer block already uses for its aux sends
//! (`builtin.mixer`: `tee → volume → queue → audiomixer`). That matters for
//! three reasons that a matrix element cannot cover:
//!
//! * **Synchronisation.** `audiomixer` is a `GstAudioAggregator`: it aligns
//!   inputs on timestamps, fills gaps with silence and normalises differing
//!   buffer sizes. `interleave` is a `GstCollectPads` element that simply
//!   waits for one buffer on every pad, so a source that stops — or an input
//!   pad that is never connected — stalls the whole router.
//! * **Fades.** Only the standalone `volume` element samples its `volume`
//!   property per sample (`volume_transform_ip` in `gstvolume.c`), which is
//!   what `crate::gst::volume_ramp` relies on. `audiomixmatrix`' `matrix` is
//!   not controllable at all, and an `audiomixer` sink pad's `volume` is
//!   sampled once per output block — both step, and a step is a click.
//! * **Gain per crosspoint.** The coefficient is a `gdouble` on a real
//!   element, so a crosspoint is a level, not a checkbox.
//!
//! ```text
//! audio_in_I → identity_in_I → deinterleave_in_I → tee_iIcC
//!
//!   tee_iIcC → xp_iIcC_oOcD (volume)      one branch per crosspoint,
//!            → mixer_O sink pad           the pad placing the mono
//!                                         on output channel D
//!
//!   mixer_O → caps_out_O → capssetter_out_O → trim_out_O (volume)
//!           → [limiter_out_O (rglimiter)] → queue_out_O → audio_out_O
//! ```
//!
//! An output bus sums every crosspoint routed to it, so a mix-minus return
//! carries N-1 talkers at unity and goes over full scale long before any one
//! of them does. `trim_out_O` and `limiter_out_O` are what it has to catch
//! that, in the order a console applies them.
//!
//! Both are off by default, and while they are off the bus is left alone down
//! to its negotiation: `caps_out_O` pins `F32LE` only once one of them is
//! engaged. That pin is the load-bearing part. An `audiomixer` saturates at
//! the sum in a fixed-point format, so with the format left open whether a
//! fan-in overload clipped inside the router or reached the output intact
//! depended on what the next block negotiated — and neither stage can undo a
//! sum that has already been saturated upstream of it.
//!
//! There is no queue on a crosspoint branch. A tee branch normally needs one
//! so it cannot block its siblings, but every branch here ends on a
//! `GstAggregatorPad`, which queues the buffer and returns rather than waiting
//! for the mix, and the bus never waits indefinitely on a pad. A queue per
//! crosspoint would be a thread per crosspoint for decoupling that is already
//! there; `queue_out_O` is where downstream is decoupled.
//!
//! Fan-out is one `tee` feeding several crosspoints; fan-in is several
//! crosspoints landing on the same mixer. An unrouted output channel simply
//! has no crosspoint at unity, so it is silent without needing a silence
//! source. Every crosspoint of the configured crossbar is built up front and
//! stays linked, so changing the routing never relinks anything — it only
//! writes gains.
