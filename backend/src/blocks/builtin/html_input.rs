//! HTML input block — a web page as a video (and audio) source.
//!
//! Chromium renders the page offscreen through `cefsrc`, which hands the
//! pipeline BGRA frames with the page's audio riding along as buffer metadata.
//! `cefdemux` splits that audio back out, so it is only built when the block
//! actually exposes an audio pad.
//!
//! ```text
//! cefsrc -> capsfilter -> cefdemux -> video -> queue -> videoconvert -> video_output -> [video_out]
//!                                  -> audio -> queue -> audioconvert -> audioresample -> audio_output -> [audio_out]
//! ```
//!
//! Both branches of the split get a queue: they leave `cefdemux` on one
//! streaming thread, so without them a sink that blocks on one branch blocks
//! the other with it.
//!
//! Video only skips `cefdemux` entirely:
//!
//! ```text
//! cefsrc -> capsfilter -> videoconvert -> video_output -> [video_out]
//! ```
//!
//! The capsfilter is what decides the render size: `cefsrc` sizes its browser
//! from the caps negotiated downstream, so width, height and framerate are
//! properties of the block rather than of anything later in the graph.
//!
//! # Why this exists as a block
//!
//! HTML sources have been raw `cefsrc`/`cefdemux` elements in imported
//! pipelines. That works, but it leaves the operator setting caps by hand, and
//! it leaves Strom with no name for "this HTML source" — which is what the
//! DevTools endpoint needs in order to hand out a link for one page rather
//! than for every page in the instance.
