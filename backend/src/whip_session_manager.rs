//! WHIP session manager for per-client whipserversrc elements.
//!
//! Each WHIP client session gets its own isolated GStreamer pipeline with a
//! whipserversrc. Media is bridged to the main pipeline via appsink→appsrc,
//! where each session is assigned to a numbered slot with independent output chains.
//!
//! Dead sessions (ICE disconnect, pipeline error) are automatically cleaned up
//! via a background task that receives cleanup requests through an mpsc channel.
