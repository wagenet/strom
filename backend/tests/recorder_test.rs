//! Regression tests for the recorder block, each built through the real
//! `RecorderBuilder` and fed from test sources the way a flow would feed it.
//!
//! One module per defect, each with the counterpart that keeps its fix from
//! being satisfied by breaking recording:
//! - `idle_input`: an unfed `splitmuxsink` recorder must not hold the pipeline
//!   short of PLAYING.
//! - `ts_passthrough_idle`: the same for the `multifilesink` of `ts_passthrough`.
//! - `unfed_track`: `splitmuxsink` pads go to connected tracks only, and to
//!   every connected track before data flows.
//! - `stalled_track`: a track that stops delivering must not freeze the rest.
//! - `splitmux_threading`: one upstream streaming task feeding every track must
//!   not deadlock `splitmuxsink`.
