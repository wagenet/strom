//! Regression tests for the recorder block, each built through the real
//! `RecorderBuilder` and fed from test sources the way a flow would feed it.
//!
//! One module per defect, each with the counterpart that keeps its fix from
//! being satisfied by breaking recording:
//! - `idle_input`: an unfed `splitmuxsink` recorder must not hold the pipeline
//!   short of PLAYING.
//! - `ts_passthrough_idle`: the same for the `multifilesink` of `ts_passthrough`.
//! - `unfed_track`: `splitmuxsink` pads go to connected tracks only, and to
//!   every connected track before data flows.
//! - `stalled_track`, in `recorder_stall_test`: a track that stops delivering
//!   must not freeze the rest.
//! - `track_resume`: a track ended that way is recorded again once it resumes.
//! - `splitmux_threading`: one upstream streaming task feeding every track must
//!   not deadlock `splitmuxsink`.

/// aligns GOPs across streams. The reference pad (video) waits in
/// `check_completed_gop` until every context reaches the next GOP start;
/// non-reference pads (audio) wait once they catch up to `max_in_running_time`,

///
/// That mutual blocking is only survivable when the pads are fed by different

/// both sink pads from `tsdemux`'s single streaming task, so the pad that
/// blocked held the only thread that could ever unblock it and recording
/// stopped within a packet or two — 0 files, or a single fragment that never
/// closed.

/// Fix: a `queue` per leg between the parser and `splitmuxsink`, giving every
