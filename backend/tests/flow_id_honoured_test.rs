//! Regression tests for `POST /api/flows` discarding the client-supplied id.
//!
//! `create_flow` used to run `flow.id = FlowId::new_v4()` unconditionally, even
//! though `id` is a required field of the request schema. A caller that
//! pre-generated an id could not create a flow and then start it by that id —
//! it had to read the assigned id back out of the response first.
//!
//! These tests call `create_flow` directly, so reverting the fix in
//! `backend/src/api/flows.rs` turns `creates_flow_with_the_supplied_id` red.
