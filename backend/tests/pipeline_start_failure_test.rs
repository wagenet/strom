//! Regression test: a pipeline that aborts its PAUSED -> PLAYING transition
//! must make `PipelineManager::start()` fail.
//!
//! `gst_element_get_state()` reports a still-running transition as `Ok(Async)`
//! and a failed one as `Err`, whatever the pending state says. `start()` used
//! to treat `Err` with `pending == Playing` as "async still in progress" and
//! return `Ok(Paused)`, so a flow whose pipeline had already posted a fatal
//! error on the bus was reported as started. `start_flow()` then went on to
//! register the flow's WHEP endpoints, but the pipeline never left PAUSED, so
//! whepserversink's signaller never opened its HTTP port and every WHEP offer
//! against that flow answered 502 for as long as it "ran".
