//! Regression test: a flow that fails to start must release what a stopped
//! flow releases.
//!
//! `start_flow()` can fail in four places, and each used to clean up its own
//! subset. The worst gap was the Media Player registry: it holds an `Arc` per
//! instance, and that `Arc`'s `Drop` is the only thing that takes the block's
//! *internal* pipeline to NULL. A Media Player flow that failed to start left a
//! decoding pipeline — and its file descriptors — running for the life of the
//! process, once per attempt.
//!
//! The registry is the part of that teardown a test can observe from outside;
//! the bus watch, the thread-priority handler and the CPU allocation are
//! released on the same path, by the same call.
//!
//! Removing the registry entry is not the same as freeing what it stands for,
//! so the second test asserts the internal pipeline itself is gone. It takes
//! the stop path rather than the failed-start path because that is the only
//! one from which a test can hold the pipeline's `WeakRef` — both run the same
//! `teardown_flow()`.
//!
//! `vision_mixer_overlay` covers the other thing a failed start used to leak:
//! the vision mixer's overlay timer thread.
